# Elixir Kata Library

Welcome to our elixir kata library. This repository is WIP from some dojos we 
participated with people instered to learn elixir. We suggest a very fun way 
to solve the problems with your friends but feel free to do it on in your way.

1. Find a tutor that have some experience with elixir. He'll guide throught the challenges.
2. Use [randori](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_dojo#Randori) to solve the 
challenges, but we added one extra rule.
3. Every round of 5/7 minutes, the tutor can have 2 minutes to answer questions 
from the rest of the group.

## Branches

* `master`: all challenges with all answers.
* `develop`: improve this repositories
* `session/<name of event and date>`: dojo applied somewhere.
